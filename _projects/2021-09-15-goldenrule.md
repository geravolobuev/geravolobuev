## <span class="mark">АЙДЕНТИКА ДЛЯ СТОМАТОЛОГИИ "ЗОЛОТОЕ СЕЧЕНИЕ"</span>

"Golden Ratio" is a dentistry whose main focus is in the field of orthodontics. The clinic uses the most effective and safe anesthesia techniques for dental treatment and prosthetics.

The client came to us with a task to create a corporate identity for the dentistry. During the first meetings, he shared his ideas and solutions within the business, his vision and we defined the main values: passion for the profession, attention to details and individual approach. The client already had a name chosen - Golden Section.

The very principle of the golden section has become a logo, and, at the same time, a modular grid for arranging and structuring content, and an element of graphics.

Identity works on all media: from stationery and printed materials to doctors' uniforms and clinic interiors. An minimalistic, modern style is supported by the choice of materials: glass, transparent plastic, and mirrors. This complements and reveals the design system.
Together with the client we went all the way to a complete independent and unique visual solution, reflecting the holistic approach and the essence of the brand.
