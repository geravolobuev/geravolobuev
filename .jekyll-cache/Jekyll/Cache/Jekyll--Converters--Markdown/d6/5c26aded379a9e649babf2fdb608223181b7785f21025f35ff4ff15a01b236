<p>“Golden Ratio” is a dentistry whose main focus is in the field of orthodontics. The clinic uses the most effective and safe anesthesia techniques for dental treatment and prosthetics.</p>

<p>The client came to us with a task to create a corporate identity for the dentistry. During the first meetings, he shared his ideas and solutions within the business, his vision and we defined the main values: passion for the profession, attention to details and individual approach. The client already had a name chosen - Golden Section.</p>

<p>The very principle of the golden section has become a logo, and, at the same time, a modular grid for arranging and structuring content, and an element of graphics.</p>

<p>Identity works on all media: from stationery and printed materials to doctors’ uniforms and clinic interiors. An minimalistic, modern style is supported by the choice of materials: glass, transparent plastic, and mirrors. This complements and reveals the design system.
Together with the client we went all the way to a complete independent and unique visual solution, reflecting the holistic approach and the essence of the brand.</p>
