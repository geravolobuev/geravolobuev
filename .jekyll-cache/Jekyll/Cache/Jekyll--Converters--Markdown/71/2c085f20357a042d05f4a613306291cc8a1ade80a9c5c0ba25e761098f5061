<p>Campaign for the Flahertiana 2021 documentary film festival.</p>

<p>Utilizing the opportunity to experiment with the existing guidelines, testing the boundaries of the typography, colours and symbols, i pushed the identity into new and exciting territory.</p>

<p>I simplified the logo (symbol of the festival is a main character from the Flaherty movie ¬´Nanook of the North¬ª) by abandoning several elements, like square, adjusting color palette, and reducing fonts usage to only one typeface. Every graphic element must does not interfere with the main thing - the image of the movie.</p>

<p>As a result, festival received a recognizable visual style that organically grew from the previous logo.</p>

<p>Figuratively, we make it clear that the festival (nanuk/director/movie etc) goes beyond the screen, into real space. It also correlates well with the idea of post-covid society‚Äôs gradual emergence from the ‚Äúfour walls.‚Äù The logo and its components become part of any plane its placed on. Every form and medium is now part of one big ¬´Nanook.‚Äù</p>

<p>The result is instantly recognisable, whilst interchangeable colours and symbol allowed for multiple variations.</p>
