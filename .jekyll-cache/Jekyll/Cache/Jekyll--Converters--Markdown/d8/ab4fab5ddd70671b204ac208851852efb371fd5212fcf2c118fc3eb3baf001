<p>Книга Пола Ардена, креативного директора в рекламном агенстве Saatchi &amp; Saatchi.<br />
Одна страница – одна глава – одна мысль. <br />
Пол объясняет, почему критика важнее признания, почему правильно быть «неправильным», как эффективно строить презентацию клиенту, и почему проще продать идею «на слафетке» чем на компьютерном рендере. <br />
Прочитав книгу становится понятно, как сильно рекламный бизнес (и дизайн в том числе) завязан именно на грамотной продаже клиенту своей работы. <br />
Главное – не бойтесь клиента и своего воображения. Именно на нем и строится настоящая креативность, а ее не всегда можно измерить метриками.</p>

<hr />

<p>Your vision of where or who you want to be is the greatest asset you have. Without having a goal its difficult to score.</p>

<p>WHY DO WE STRIVE FOR EXCELLENCE WHEN MEDIOCRITY IS REQUIRED?<br />
All creative people need something to reel against. Its what gives their lives excitement, and its creative people who make the clients lives exciting</p>

<p>DO NOT SEEK PRAISE. SEEK CRITICISM.<br />
Instead, ask «what’s wrong with my work? How can I make it better?»</p>

<p>DO NOT COVET YOUR IDEAS.<br />
The more you give away, the more comes back to you.<br />
Ideas are open knowledge.</p>

<p>DONT LOOK FOR THE NEXT OPPORTUNITY. THE ONE YOU HAVE IN HAND IS THE OPPORTUNITY.<br />
Whatever brief is on your desk right now, that’s the one. Make it the best you possibly can.</p>

<p>ACCENTUATE THE POSITIVE – ELIMINATE THE NEGATIVE  <br />
FIND out that’s right about your product or service and then dramatize it, like a cartoonist exaggerates an action. <br />
AVOID knocking the competition.</p>

<p>DONT PROMISE WHAT YOU CAN’T DELIVER
If you undersell, pointing out the possible weaknesses and how to resolve them, should they occur, you are not only building a trusting relationship with your client but you are able to solve any problems.</p>

<p>KNOW YOUR CLIENTS AIMS<br />
MOST clients are corporate people protecting their own mortgages. They mistakenly see ideas as a risk rather than an advancement to their careers. <br />
Therefore their motivation may be quite different from their brief to you.<br />
Find out what’s the clients real objective is.<br />
ALL clients aspire to status.</p>

<p>WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN YOUR CLIENT WONT BUY?<br />
Do it his way, then do it your way.<br />
If you show to client what you want and not what he wants, he’ll say that’s not what he asked for.<br />
If, however, you show him what he wants first, he is then relaxed and is prepared to look at what you want to sell him.</p>

<p>WHEN IT CANT BE DONE, DO IT. IF YOU DONT DO IT, IT DOESNT EXIST<br />
A new idea can’t be judged by description. It needs to be done. You may have to beg, steal and borrow to get it done. At whatever cost.</p>

<p>ITS WRONG TO BE RIGHT<br />
Knowledge comes from the past, so its safe. Experience is build from solutions to old problems.<br />
Its the opposite of being creative.</p>

<p>ITS RIGHT TO BE WRONG<br />
Risks are measure of people. Being wrong isn’t anywhere but being here, now.</p>

<p>DONT BE AFRAID OF SILLY IDEAS<br />
The way to get unblocked is to lose our inhibitions and stop worrying about being right.<br />
High creativity is responding to situations without critical thought.<br />
Do the opposite of what the solution requires.<br />
Look out of the window and whatever catches your eye, make that the solution to your problem.</p>

<p>PLAY YOUR CARDS RIGHT<br />
Between saying «pump attendant» and «petroleum executive» lies a big difference. Be more ambitious about yourself and your presentation. <br />
How you percieve yourself is how others will see you.</p>

<p>ITS NOT WHO YOU ARE. ITS WHO YOU KNOW<br />
Don’t burden yourself in your work. Get social. Talk yourself up and present your credentials.</p>

<p>DONT GIVE A SPEACH. PUT ON A SHOW<br />
Instead of giving people the benefit of your wit and wisdom (words) try painting them a picture.<br />
The more strikingly visual your presentation is, the more people will remember it.</p>

<p>COMPOSE YOUR AD FROM THE WEAKEST POINT<br />
The villain is not always the client. It is the fashion of the day. <br />
Be unfashionable. Take risks.</p>

<p>ROUGH LAYOUTS SELL THE IDEA BETTER THAN POLISHED ONES<br />
If you show your client a highly polished layout, he will probably reject it. <br />
There is nothing for him to do. Its not his work. He doesn’t feel involved.<br />
It is very difficult for him to imagine anything else if what you show him has such detail.<br />
Show the client a scribble.<br />
Explain it to him, talk him through it, let him use his imagination.<br />
Get him involved.</p>

<p>IF YOU HET STUCK, DRAW WITH A DIFFERENT PEN<br />
Change your tools, it may free your thinking.</p>

<p>HOW TO IMPROVE YOUR STRIKE RATE<br />
Lines (slogans) wins business. If you can sum up what the clients want to feel about his company but cannot express himself, you’ve got him.<br />
Present creative work first. <br />
Finally, present on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The most popular conception of creativity is that it’s something to do with arts.<br />
Nonsense.<br />
Creativity is imagination, and imagination is for everyone.</p>
