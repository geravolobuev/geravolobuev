## David Carson course notes

Use your intuition. Trust it. 

Register things. With your phone. 

Send a message with typography. 

Dont be lazy. Decide, what you want to tell with your chosen font.

Make things your own. 

Never snap to guides. You should be making these decisions.

let the photography decide which design should acompany its better.

Tight cropping can add energy.

a logo - is an image. you must recognize it from the distance. 

the less literal the logo is - the better.

logos can help humanize the subject.

at the start, logos should work on the small scale and B&W.
Colors follows after.

Read that brief. Read it well. And what do you get from that? What are you seeing? What are you feeling? Something in there is 
gonna trigger something in you. That’s the direction you start exploring with your design work.

Give clients more options at the start. Show a lot of ideas. (and make sure that you actually like all of them)

Live in a place, which allows you to focus on the type of work you want to do most.

Limit distractions. Try to turning-of internet. Do whatever you need to focus.

Dont do your work on “autopilot” - try to help the story you are working on by your graphic decision.

Dont put things in obvious places.

Legibility alone don’t guarantee communication. You can judge a book by its cover.
