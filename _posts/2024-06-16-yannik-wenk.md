## Yannik Wenk – Developing Design Systems in 3D

We can make sense of wildly different shapes, because we understand their function from experience.

Look at the world imagining that everything you see is an abstract shape with no function or purpose.

“Every time a child encounters a table, it stores the experience.
Based on similarities between the tables, the child’s brain will abstract the properties and functions to form the category ‘table’.”

We look at the product the same way we look at the abstract shapes. Only through that we can find the emotional connection with shapes. 

If there is no product to show, use emotional abstraction.

Good design system consists of rules, ranges of flexibility and randomness. These are also pillars of proceduralism. And this allows for automating design systems.

In a novel all words are there, our brain creates the image.
In abstract animation all images are there, and our brand writes the story.
