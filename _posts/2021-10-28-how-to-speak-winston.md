## <span class="mark">How to Speak - Patrick Henry Winston</span>
 
**How to Start**   
Dont begin with a joke.  

Start with the promise, how the audience will be empowered by the talk. 

Even before the promise, you can start with the «menu» - outline of what you expect to cover.

**The big four**
1. Cycle on the material. At least 3 times. 
2. Use verbal punctuation. 
3. Near miss. Explain concept by nearest examples to it.
4. Ask question. They should be frequent and answerable. Wait a little while for answer.

**Time & place**
Try to schedule the talk to the morning hours.  
The place should be well lid.  
Choose a place that can be filled completely with listeners.  

**Blackboard**
Draw.  
Make lists  
Use blackboard as a target.   

**Overhead**
Dont read your slides. Audience can read too.  

**Props**
Use props for demonstrations.   

**Style**
Adapt, dont copy style.  
Its ok to be eccentric.   
Tell stories.  

**How to stop**
Dont thank the audience.  
Tell joke.  
Deliver.  
Ask for questions.  
Salute the audience.
