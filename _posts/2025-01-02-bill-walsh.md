## Bill Walsh - Score Takes Care of Itself

#### To Succeed You Must Fail
One of the profound lessons I have learned during my career, namely, that even when you have an organization brimming with talent, victory is not always under your control. Rather, it’s like quicksilver—fleeting and elusive, not something you can summon at will even under the best circumstances. Almost always, your road to victory goes through a place called “failure.”

The ability to help the people around me self-actualize their goals underlines the single aspect of my abilities and the label that I value most—teacher.

When the inevitable setback, loss, failure, or defeat comes crashing down on you—losing a big sale, being passed over for a career-making promotion, even getting fired—allow yourself the “grieving time,” but then recognize that the road to recovery and victory lies in having the strength to get up off the mat and start planning your next move.
This is how you must think if you want to win. Otherwise you have lost.

#### MY FIVE DOS FOR GETTING BACK INTO THE GAME: 
1. Do expect defeat. It’s a given when the stakes are high and the competition is working ferociously to beat you. If you’re surprised when it happens, you’re dreaming; dreamers don’t last long.
2. Do force yourself to stop looking backward and dwelling on the professional “train wreck” you have just been in.  It’s mental quicksand.
3. Do allow yourself appropriate recovery—grieving—time.  You’ve been knocked senseless; give yourself a little time to recuperate. A keyword here is “little.” Don’t let it drag on.
4. Do tell yourself, “I am going to stand and fight again,” with the knowledge that often when things are at their worst you’re closer than you can imagine to success. Our Super Bowl victory arrived less than sixteen months after my “train wreck” in Miami.
5. Do begin planning for your next serious encounter. The smallest steps—plans—move you forward on the road to recovery. Focus on the fix.

MY FIVE DON’TS: 
1. Don’t ask, “Why me?”
2. Don’t expect sympathy.
3. Don’t bellyache.
4. Don’t keep accepting condolences.
5. Don’t blame others.”

#### STANDARD OF PERFORMANCE
Great teams in business, in sports, or elsewhere have a conscience. At its best, an organization—your team—bespeaks values and a way of doing things that emanate from a source; that source is you—the leader. Thus, the dictates of your personal beliefs should ultimately become characteristics of your team.

My Standard of Performance—the values and beliefs within it—guided everything I did in my work at San Francisco and are defined as follows: Exhibit a ferocious and intelligently applied work ethic directed at continual improvement; demonstrate respect for each person in the organization and the work he or she does; be deeply committed to learning and teaching, which means increasing my own expertise; be fair; demonstrate character; honor the direct connection between details and improvement, and relentlessly seek the latter; show self-control, especially where it counts most—under pressure; demonstrate and prize loyalty; use positive language and have a positive attitude; take pride in my effort as an entity  separate from the result of that effort; be willing to go the extra distance for the organization; deal appropriately with victory and defeat, adulation and humiliation (don’t get crazy with victory nor dysfunctional with loss); promote internal communication that is both open and substantive (especially under stress); seek poise in myself and those I lead; put the team’s welfare and priorities ahead of my own; maintain an ongoing level of concentration and focus that is abnormally high; and make sacrifice and commitment the organization’s trademark.

From the start, my prime directive, the fundamental goal, was the full and total implementation throughout the organization of the actions and attitudes of the Standard of Performance

I had no grandiose plan or timetable for winning a championship, but rather a comprehensive standard and plan for installing a level of proficiency—competency—at which our production level would become higher in all areas, both on and off the field, than that of our opponents. Beyond that, I had faith that the score would take care of itself.

During this early period I began hiring personnel with four characteristics I value most highly: talent, character, functional intelligence (beyond basic intelligence, the ability to think on your feet, quickly and spontaneously), and an eagerness to adopt my way of doing things, my philosophy.

I was insisting that all employees not only raise their level of “play” but dramatically lift the level of their thinking—how they perceived their relationship to the team and its members; how they approached the vagaries of competition; and how willing they were to sacrifice for the goals I identified.
Much of this relates to the respect and sensitivity we accorded one another and to an appreciation of the roles each member of our organization fulfilled. Each player had a connection to and was an extension of his teammates.

The leader’s job is to facilitate a battlefield-like sense of camaraderie among his or her personnel, an environment for people to find a way to bond together, to care about one another and the work they do, to feel the connection and extension so necessary for great results. Ultimately, it’s the strongest bond of all, even stronger than money.

The culture precedes positive results. Champions behave like champions before they’re champions; they have a winning standard of performance before they are winners.

#### Establishing Your Standard of Performance
In quantifying and implementing your own version of the Standard of Performance, the following guidelines are a good reference point:
1. Start with a comprehensive recognition of, reverence for, and identification of the specific actions and attitudes  relevant to your team’s performance and production. 
2. Be clarion clear in communicating your expectation of high effort and execution of your Standard of Performance. Like water, many decent individuals will seek lower ground if left to their own inclinations. In most cases you are  the one who inspires and demands they go upward rather than settle for the comfort of doing what comes easily. Push them beyond their comfort zone; expect them to give extra effort.
3. Let all know that you expect them to possess the highest level of expertise in their area of responsibility. 
4. Beyond standards and methodology, teach your beliefs, values, and philosophy. An organization is not an inanimate object. It is a living organism that you must nurture, guide, and strengthen.
5. Teach “connection and extension.” An organization filled with individuals who are “independent contractors” unattached to one another is a team with little interior cohesion and strength.
.6. Make the expectations and metrics of competence that you demand in action and attitudes from personnel the new reality of your organization. 

Creating gold from dross is alchemy; making lemonade when you’re given lemons is leadership; making lemonade when you don’t have any lemons is great leadership.

In a sense, the naysayers were seeking victory, but only if it came the old-fashioned way. They were locked into the past and unwittingly locking themselves out of the future. Leaders do this to themselves and their organizations all the time.

#### Lessons of the Bill Walsh Offense
My new short precision pass-oriented offense was ostensibly created out of nothing. In fact, it was created out of existing assets that only needed to be “seen” and then capitalized on in new ways. There are several elements in its evolution that are worth evaluating as they pertain to your own leadership.
1. Success doesn’t care which road you take to get to its doorstep. The traditionalists—rigid and resistant in their thinking—who sneered at the new passing system I was creating were soon trying to figure out why it was beating them and how to copy it.
2. Be bold. Remove fear of the unknown—that is, change—from your mind. Respect the past without clinging to it: “That’s the way we’ve always done it” is the mantra of a team setting itself up to lose to an organization that’s not doing it that way any more.
3. Desperation should not drive innovation. Here’s a good  question to write on a Post-it Note and put on your desk: “What assets do we have right now that we’re not taking advantage of?”. While waiting to get what you want—a “quarterback with a strong arm”—make the most of what you’ve got.”
4. Be obsessive in looking for the upside in the downside.  My evaluation of Virgil Carter’s “weak” résumé, his so-called limited assets, led directly to utilizing them productively. Why? Instead of looking for reasons we couldn’t make it work, I sought solutions that would make it succeed.

#### Welcome Skeptics to Your Team
In your own challenges, are you receptive to new, even unorthodox ways of getting things done? 

The fact that we had seemingly no options forced us to come up with new options—the West Coast Offense. But should desperation be the primary determinant for seeking new direction, innovative solutions?

#### Share the Glory
Give ample credit to those working with me. Few things offer greater return on less investment than  praise—offering credit to someone in your organization who has stepped up and done the job.

#### Write Your Own Script for Success
Having a well-thought-out plan ready to go in advance of a change in the weather is the key to success. I came to understand this when I realized that making decisions off the top of my head was a recipe for a bad decision—especially under pressure. 

The motto of the Boy Scouts, “Be Prepared,” became my modus ope randi, and to be prepared I had to factor in every contingency: good weather, bad weather, and everything in between. I kept asking and answering this question: “What do I do if . . . ?”

It’s the same for you, of course: “What do you do if . . . ?” Most leaders take this no deeper than the first level of inquiry. You must envision the future deeply and in detail—creatively—so that the unforeseeable becomes foreseeable. Then you write your script for the foreseeable.

Scripting was a preprepared format, a flexible blueprint that I used to navigate through the turmoil, uncertainty, and stress of competition. “If this situation arises, we do this; if this happens, we do that.” On and on. It was almost by the numbers.

#### Protect Your Blind Side: The Leadership Two-Step: Move/Countermove
You may have to prompt yourself to continually and aggressively analyze not only your personnel but your organization’s vulnerabilities: What’s our blind side? What are the implications of the competition’s recent initiative? What’s our countermove to their move? Or is one even necessary?

#### The Archaeology of Leadership: Seek Reward in the Ruins
Every leader does year-end reviews and comes to conclusions of one  sort or another. My observation is that two leaders—coaches—looking at the same information will not see the same thing. The one who’s a more skilled analyst, who digs deeper and wider, will benefit more. It is an endeavor to which I allocated as much energy as my preparation for every game and opponent.

In planning for a successful future, the past can show you how to get there.

#### “I Am the Leader!”
Someone will declare, “I am the leader!” and expect everyone to get in line and follow him or her to the gates of heaven or hell. My experience is that it doesn’t happen that way. Unless you’re a guard on a chain gang, others follow you based on the quality of your actions rather than the magnitude of your declarations.

#### The Common Denominator of Leadership: Strength of Will
The leader who will not be denied, who has expertise coupled with strength of will, is going to prevail.

Some leaders are volatile, some voluble; some stoic, others exuberant; but all successful leaders know where we want to go, figure out a way we believe will get the organization there (after careful consideration of relevant available information), and then move forward with absolute determination. 

It is good to remind yourself that this quality—strength of will—is  essential to your survival and success.

You may be standing alone. This is when you find out if you’re a leader.

In my years as a head coach, I wanted a democratic-style organization with input and communication and freedom of expression, even opinions that were at great variance with my ideas. But only up to a point. When it was time for a decision, that decision would be made by me according to dictates having to do with one thing only, namely, making the team better.

And once the decision was made, the discussion was over. My ultimate job, and yours, is not to give an opinion. Everybody’s got an opinion. Leaders are paid to make a decision. The difference between offering an opinion and making a decision is the difference between working for the leader and being the leader.

#### Be Wrong for the Right Reasons
So the question is this: How do you know when it’s time to quit, to try another approach, to move in a different direction.

When is it time to say, “I’m wrong”? Here’s the answer: There is no answer; there is no cut-and-dried formula.

A leader must be keen and alert to what drives a decision, a plan of action. If it was based on good logic, sound principles, and strong belief, I felt comfortable in being unswerving in moving toward my goal. Any other reason (or reasons) for persisting were examined carefully. Among the most common faulty reasons are (1) trying to prove you are right and (2) trying to prove someone else is wrong.

Here’s a short checklist worth keeping in mind when it comes to persevering, to doing it “your way” at all costs:
1. A leader must never quit.
2. A leader must know when to quit.
3. Proving that you are right or proving that someone is wrong are bad reasons for persisting.
4. Good logic, sound principles, and strong belief are the purest and most productive reasons for pushing forward when things get rough.

#### Protect Your Turf
Leaders who don’t understand what their territory is and how to protect it will soon find themselves with no turf to protect.

#### Be a Leader—Twelve Habits Plus One
When you fall prey to the naysayers who eagerly provide you with all the reasons why you won’t succeed, why you can’t win, and why you should quit, you have lost the winner’s edge. When that happens, the game is over, regardless of your profession.

Here are twelve habits I have identified over the years that will make you be a better leader:
1. Be Yourself! You must be the best version of yourself that you can be; stay within the framework of your own personality and be authentic. If you’re faking it, you’ll be found out.
2. Be committed to excellence. My commitment to this “product”—excellence—preceded my commitment to winning football  games. At all times, in all ways, your focus must be on doing things at the highest possible level.
3. Be positive. I spent far more time teaching what to do than what not to do; far more time teaching and encouraging individuals than criticizing them; more time building up than tearing down. There is a constructive place for censure and highlighting negative aspects of a situation, but too often it is done simply to vent and creates a barrier between you and others. Maintain an affirmative, constructive, positive environment.
4. Be prepared. (Good luck is a product of good planning.)  Work hard to get ready for expected situations—events you know will happen. Equally important, plan and prepare for the unexpected. “What happens when what’s supposed to happen doesn’t happen?” is the question that you must always be asking and solving. No leader can control the outcome of the contest or competition, but you can control how you prepare for it.
5. Be detail-oriented. High performance is achieved small step by small step through painstaking dedication to pertinent details.
6. Be organized. You must think clearly with a disciplined mind, especially in regard to the most efficient and productive use of time and resources.
7. Be accountable. “Answerability  starts with you. If you make excuses—which is first cousin to “alibiing”—so will those around you.
8. Be near-sighted and far-sighted. Keep everything in perspective while simultaneously concentrating fully on the task at hand. All decisions should be made with an eye toward how they affect the organization’s performance—not how they affect you or your feelings. All efforts and plans should be considered not only in terms of short-run effect, but also in terms of how they impact the organization long term
9. Be fair. Be clear in your own mind as to what you stand for. And then stand up for it.
10. Be firm. I would not budge one inch on my core values, standards, and principles. 
11. Be flexible. “Consistency is crucial, but you must be quick to adjust to new challenges that defy the old solutions.
12. Believe in yourself. To a large degree, a leader must “sell” himself to the team. This is impossible unless you exhibit self-confidence.
13. Be a leader. You must be able to inspire and motivate through teaching people how to execute their jobs at the highest level. You must care about people and help those people care about one another and the team’s goals. And you must never second-guess yourself  on decisions you make with integrity, intelligence, and a team-first attitude.

#### Sweat the Right Small Stuff: Sharp Pencils Do Not Translate into Sharp Performance
As a leader, when you find yourself with a host of problems that seemingly defy solution and start dwelling on the least relevant or even irrelevant aspects of your job. 
Tell yourself this: “There’ll be plenty of time for pencils, parties, and socializing when I lose my job, because that’s what’s going to happen if I continue to avoid the hard and harsh realities of doing my job.

Here are ten additional nails you can pound into your professional coffin:
1.  Exhibit patience, paralyzing patience.
2. Engage in delegating—massive delegating—or conversely, engage in too little delegating.
3. Act in a tedious, overly cautious manner.
4. Become best buddies with certain employees.
5. Spend excessive amounts of time socializing with superiors or subordinates.
6. Fail to continue hard-nosed performance evaluations of longtime—“tenured”—staff members, the ones most likely to go on cruise control, to relax.
7. Fail to actively participate in efforts to appraise and acquire new hires.
8. Trust others to carry out your fundamental duties.
9. Find ways to get out from under the responsibilities of your position, to move accountability from yourself to others—the blame game.
10. Promote an organizational environment that is comfortable and laid-back in the misbelief that the workplace should be fun, lighthearted, and free from appropriate levels of tension and urgency.

#### Good Leadership Percolates Down
If your staff doesn’t seem fully mobilized and energized until you enter the room, if they require your presence to carry on at the level of effort and excellence you have tried to install, your leadership has not percolated down.

#### You Must Have a Hard Edge
leader needs a very hard edge inside; it has to lurk in there somewhere and come out on occasion. You must be able to make and carry out harsh and, at times, ruthless decisions in a manner that is fast, firm, and fair. Applied correctly, this hard edge will not only solve the immediate difficulty, but also prevent future problems by sending out this important message: Cross my line and you can expect severe consequences. This will have ongoing benefits for your organization.

From time to time, leaders must show this hard edge. They must make those around them somewhat uneasy, even ill at ease, in not knowing what to expect from you, the leader. The knowledge that there is this hardness inside you can have a very sobering effect on those who might otherwise be sloppy—those who occasionally need to be reminded of your policies and practices.

#### Montana’s Leadership by Example: Cool, Calm, and Collected
Joe Montana’s leadership was grounded in this key characteristic: Despite the fact that he was the starting quarterback, with all of the trappings that come with that position, he never played favorites or believed that a person’s reputation, status, or credentials entitled him to special treatment. When you worked with Joe, you were treated as an equal. There were no stars in the Montana system, including Joe Montana. That corny old cliché, “One for all and all for one,” could have been written with him in mind.

Montana’s kind of leadership is a great starting point, in my view, for what any good leader strives to do, namely, bring out the best in people. In order to manage people effectively, you must act responsibly and professionally in your capacity as leader. In this regard, you should employ an approach that is based on the following principles:
1. Treat people like people. Every player on our team wore a number; no player on our team was “just a number.” Treat each member of your organization as a unique person. I was never pals with players, but I never viewed any of them as an anonymous member of an organizational herd.
2. Seek positive relationships through encouragement, support, and critical evaluation. Maintain an uplifting atmosphere at work with your ongoing positive, enthusiastic, energizing behavior.
3. Afford everyone equal dignity, respect, and treatment. 
4. Blend honesty and “diplomacy.” At times, it is both humane and practical to soften the heavy blow of a demotion or termination with compassion and empathy. It will also help prevent or reduce a toxic response that can ripple  through the organization when word spreads that someone feels he or she has been treated roughly “without cause. Nevertheless, “rough treatment” serves a purpose occasionally.
5. Allow for a wide range of moods, from serious to very relaxed, in the workplace depending on the circumstances. Set the acceptable tone by your own demeanor, and develop the fine art of knowing when to crack the whip or crack a joke.
6. Avoid pleading with players to “get going” or trying to relate to them by adopting their vernacular. Strong leaders don’t plead with individuals to perform.
7. Make each person in your employ very aware that his or her well-being has a high priority with the organization  and that the well-being of the organization must be his or her highest professional priority.
8. Give no VIP treatment. Except on a very short-term “reward” basis that is understood as such—for example, a special parking spot for the employee of the month.
9. Speak in positive terms about former members of your organization. This creates a very positive impression and signals that respect and loyalty extend beyond an individual’s time on your payroll.1
10. Demonstrate interest in and support for the extended families of members of the organization.
11. Communicate on a first-name basis without allowing relationships to become buddy-buddy. Deep resentments  can develop when others see you playing favorites by exhibiting a special bond with select members of the group.
12. Don’t let differences or animosity linger. Cleanse the wound before it gets infected.

#### The Leverage of Language
When I criticized or gave feedback to someone, it wasn’t defeatist. It  was always focused on the here and now and never conjured up images or incidents of poor play over the previous days or weeks 

Employees can thrive in an environment where they know exactly what is expected of them—even when those expectations are very high.
When it comes to telling people what you expect from them, don’t be subtle, don’t be coy, don’t be vague.

Quality collaboration is only possible in the presence of quality communication; that is, the free-flowing and robust exchange of information, ideas, and opinions. And “having big ears”—the skill of being a great listener—is the first law of good communication. (The second law is “When you’re not listening, ask good questions.”)

If someone told me that leadership is as easy as one, two, three, I’d reply, “Only if the one, two, and three are as follows:1. Listen2. Learn3. Lead”

Everybody can be a winner when “Be a Good Listener” is at the top of your leadership mission statement. Good collaboration begins with big ears.

#### Create Uncertainty
The people around you must feel somewhat on edge with you at times because they know there’s another side of your personality—ill at ease because they don’t always know what to expect and have come to understand there’s a toughness within you. Ideally, those you lead are driven to excel by the expertise, example, inspiration, and motivation you offer—the Standard of Performance you define and personify—but sometimes you have to snarl to remind them of the consequences of straying from your standards.
This is part of the tough (at times severe) side of leadership necessary to eliminate a comfort zone, which can creep into an organization and keep it from pushing on to higher and higher levels. One of the tools I used to accomplish this was to emulate Pete Newell—to shake things up with a somewhat contrived show of temper that comes from nowhere and disappears just as quickly.

Sometimes you snarl; sometimes you bite; sometimes you smile and give a thumbs-up. There’s a little bit of the actor in all good leaders.

#### Teaching Defines Your Leadership
1. Passion is not just having a desire to do the job of teaching.
2. Expertise is the inventory of knowledge and experience you possess on a particular subject.
3. Communication is the ability to organize and then successfully convey your informed thoughts.
4. Persistence is essential because knowledge is rarely imparted on the first attempt.

While passion, expertise, communication, and persistence are the four essentials of good teaching and learning, I would also add these nuts-and-bolts practices to facilitate what you do as a leader who is a great teacher:
1. Use straightforward language. No need to get fancy.
2. Be concise. For many leaders it’s harder to be brief than to be long-winded. We love to hear ourselves talk.
3. Account for a wide range of difference in knowledge, experience, and comprehension among members of your organization.”
4. Account for some members of the group being more receptive and ready to learn than others (for reasons out of your control)
5. Be observant during your comments. Know if you’re connecting.”
6. Strongly encourage note taking.
7. Employ a somewhat unpredictable presentation style.  “Droning on” is the most common style, and you may have to work on stepping it up so that you don’t fall into the “drone trap.”
8. Organize with logical, sequential building blocks in your communication. 
9. Encourage appropriate audience participation. 
10. Use visual aids. 
11. Remember Sun-tzu: “With more sophistication comes more control.” The more you work at refining your teaching—increasing its sophistication—the greater your control of the teaching (and learning) process.

#### You’re as Good as Your Good People
My checklist of personal qualities—assets—in potential staff members:
1. A fundamental knowledge of the area he or she has been hired to manage.
2. A relatively high—but not manic—level of energy and enthusiasm and a personality that is upbeat, motivated, and animated.
3. The ability to discern talent in potential employees whom he or she will recommend to you.
4. An ability to communicate in a relaxed yet authoritative—but not authoritarian—manner.
5. Unconditional loyalty to both you and other staff members.”

My checklist for keeping good staff members on the same page:
1. You must establish clear parameters for your staff regarding the overall method by which you expect things to be done.
2. Any philosophical differences that crop up must be identified and addressed by you in private meetings with the individual(s).
3. “You must recognize that staff members may work in different ways, using approaches that are at variance with yours.
4. “To ensure unanimity throughout the staff, make unannounced visits to various department meetings.
5. “Don’t cede inordinate power or control to a staff member  simply because you are relieved to have an experienced and proven performer come on board.
6. “Sometimes a staff member may intentionally teach a philosophy that is at odds with your code of conduct, in the belief that it conforms to your philosophy.
7. “Be alert for those staff members who seek to use their position to teach and express their personal beliefs.
8. “Remember Mike Ditka’s comment on leadership after his Bears won a Super Bowl championship: “Personal contact is part of hands-on management. Go to the other guy’s office; tell him what you have in mind so there is no misunderstanding.

#### The Under: Strive to Be a One-Point Underdog
Ideally, I wanted to instill in each member of our group the belief that, regardless of the opponent, we were a one-point underdog, that the upcoming team was just a little better  than we were or had motivation enough to really raise their level of play. 

#### A Big Cheer for a Big Ego
Commitment and sacrifice are among the personal characteristics I value most highly in people

Don’t let anybody tell you that a big ego is a bad thing

“In evaluating people, I prize ego. It often translates into a fierce desire to do their best and an inner confidence that stands them in good stead when things really get rough.

#### Use the Four Most Powerful Words
You need to stretch people to help them achieve their full potential. The most powerful way to do this is by having the courage to say, “I believe in you,” in whatever words and way are comfortable for you. These four words—or their equivalents—constitute the most inspirational message a leader can convey. There are many different ways to do it, but the fundamental and underlying message must always be the same: “I believe in you. I know you can do the job

And always keep this in mind: Nobody will ever come back to you later and say “thank you” for expecting too little of them.

#### Hold on Until Help Arrives: Keep Your Boss in the Loop
Whether they read it or not, flood your superiors with information that is documented—projections, evaluations, reports on progress, status updates. Then ask for periodic meetings. In a very professional way, force them to understand that you’re doing everything you possibly can and that it’s documented; in fact, they’re holding it in that large folder in their hands. Open and honest communication with your superiors, both written and verbal, is a valuable tool in keeping them from coming to the wrong conclusions.

#### Keep Your Eye on the Ball
While mollifying those who may decide your fate during a losing streak or turnaround effort—the boss, board of directors, or shareholders—you also need to be absolutely disciplined in focusing your own attention on what really matters. Here are a dozen daily reminders that will help keep you on the right track:
1. Concentrate on what will produce results rather than on the results, the process rather than the prize.
2. Exhibit an inner toughness emanating from four of the most effective survival tools a leader can possess: expertise, composure, patience, and common sense.
3. Maintain your level of professional ethics and all details of your own Standard of Performance.
4. Don’t isolate yourself. Keep in mind that as troubles mount, your relationships with personnel become even more critical. They are the key to holding the staff together. (Don’t get too friendly, however. Familiarity can be deadly.)
5. Don’t let the magnitude of the challenge take you away from the incremental steps necessary to effect change.  Continue to be detail oriented.
6. Exude an upbeat and determined attitude. Never, ever  express doubt, but avoid an inappropriate sunny optimism in dark times.
7. Hold meetings with staff educating them on what to expect; teach them that the immediate future may be a rough ride but that things will change under your leadership and with their support.
8. Don’t label some concept or new plan the thing that will “get us back on track.” Keep in mind that simple remedies seldom solve a complex problem.
9. Ensure that an appropriate level of courtesy and respect is extended to all members of the organization. When things are tough, civility is a great asset.
10. Don’t plead with employees to “do better.” 
11. Avoid continual threatening or chastising. 
12. Deal with your immediate superior(s) on a one-to-one, ongoing basis. Expect betrayal if results are not immediate. (You extend the time before betrayal occurs by keeping your superiors in the loop.)

#### Sine Qua Non: Your Work Ethic
For me, the starting point for everything—before strategy, tactics, theories, managing, organizing, philosophy, methodology, talent, or experience—is the work ethic. Without one of significant magnitude you’re dead in the water, finished.

A commander must accustom his staff to a high tempo from the outset, and continuously keep them up to it. If he once allows himself to be satisfied with norms, or anything less than an all-out effort, he gives up the race from the starting post, and will sooner or later be taught a bitter lesson.

You cannot do that if you’re invisible, cooped up in your office instead of being out there with your team. A leader’s great work ethic must been  seen to be perceived, must be perceived if it is to be the organization’s  norm.

#### Unleash Mentors: Tell Your Team to Teach
I made teachers out of my students. The players became coaches. This built-in crew of teachers exists in your own organization. Tap into it.

My philosophy of team members teaching new arrivals the organization’s system, not just X’s and O’s but the attitudes and actions of performance, is essential to a self-sustaining winning organization. It is accomplished through mentoring within your organization. And for mentoring to exist, members of your team must truly believe that their first loyalty is to furthering the good of the group: “What is good for us is good  for me.” That’s tough to teach, but it’s part of the connection and extension principle that was built into my Standard of Performance.

#### Nine Steps for a Healthy Heart
Let me suggest nine steps you can take that involve treating people right, for having a healthy heart in your organization:
1. Afford each person the same respect, support, and fair treatment you would expect if your roles were reversed.
2. “Leadership involves many people, each with their own need for role identity within the organization. Find what a person does best, utilize and emphasize it, and steer clear of his or her weaknesses.
3. Demonstrate a pronounced commitment to employees by providing a work environment that enables them to achieve their maximum potential and productivity.
4. Acknowledge the uniqueness of each employee
5. The most talented personnel often are very independent minded. This requires that you carefully consider how you relate to and communicate with this type of individual. Creative people usually bring a passion to seeing their ideas put into play as quickly as possible. They must be helped to understand that not every idea is appropriate and that coming up with a new concept is just the start of a process that includes evaluation, comparisons, practicability, and more. But be careful not to quash an idea-friendly environment in your organization
6. While at times a divergence may exist between the good  of the group and the good of the individual, in a best-case scenario the group’s and the individual’s “good” should be the same. When this is not the case, you are well served to explain the reasons behind the divergence to the person who feels badly treated—for example, when he or she is passed over for promotion. (For me, occasionally a player wanted to play one position when, in fact, he was better suited to another. I attempted to explain this to the individual whose goal was being denied. You may have an individual who similarly needs direction to play to his or her strength within your organization. And you may have to explain how this benefits the goal of the team.)
7. People are most comfortable with how they are being treated when their duties are laid out in specific detail  and their performance can be gauged by specific metrics. The key is to document—clarify—those expectations.
8. It is critical that employee expectation levels be reasonable, attainable, and high. While you should exhibit flexibility in the work environment to accommodate the needs of employees, you should be inflexible with regard to your  expectations of their performance.
9. Establish a protocol for how members of the organization interact with one another. This is essential to preventing compartmentalization and “turf protection.” Let them know their first priority is to do their job; their second priority is to facilitate others in doing their jobs.
